            <h3>Evolve Simulation</h3>
            <p>Description: Evolve Simulations is an AI-powered experiential learning platform that delivers simulation training through virtual roleplay with realistic characters in free flowing conversations. We design and build bespoke communication simulations that deliver the training and education outcomes required by any organisation in any industry. </p>
            <p>Technologies Used: Unity Engine, Meta Quest 3, OpenAI </p>
            <p>Challenges and Solutions: I faced challenges with the rate that the AI will respond in application. The team wanted quick response to feel like a real conversation. The process required finding fast STT, AI Response and TTS. We managed to get it down by change diffrent sdks and moving some processes off the application to be run on a private server</p>

            <h3> PLTS : Electrician Training Module (LiminalVR)</h3>
            <p>Description: The PLTS is a revolutionary virtual reality program that offers managers and leaders the opportunity to develop positive leadership and communication skills by interacting with virtual reality avatars across common workplace scenarios. This innovative program will help managers in the prevention of injury and illness of young workers. The specfic module worked was for training electricians in specfic way on PC </p>
            <p>Technologies Used: Unity Engine, PC-Build</p>
            <p>Challenges and Solutions: The challenge faced was handling complex interactions real life interactions into a simple PC application. With some inspiration for Electrician Simulator, we found a solution that only requires point and click for actions and dialogue</p>
